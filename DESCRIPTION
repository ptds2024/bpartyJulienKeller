Version: 0.1.0
Author: Julien Keller
Maintainer: Julien Keller <julien.keller@unil.ch>
Description: This package provides a suite of tools to assist in resource 
    planning for birthday parties, focusing on ice cream cone calculations 
    and weather-based guest predictions. It includes functions to compute 
    the volume and surface area of cones using numerical integration, simulate 
    the total ice cream and coating requirements based on weather conditions, 
    and estimate guest behavior using statistical models. Additionally, the 
    package features an interactive Shiny application for exploring and visualizing 
    weather data and its impact on party planning. Designed for both practical 
    and educational purposes, the package helps users efficiently manage party 
    resources while learning fundamental R programming concepts.
